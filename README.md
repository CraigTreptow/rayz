# Rayz

An implementation of a ray tracer based on the ["The Ray Tracer Challenge"](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge) book in Ruby.

## Set Up

This uses [Jetlify's devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox), so you'll need to install that first.

See `devbox.json` for details on what is installed.

1. `devbox shell`
1. `bundle install`

## Running

`ruby -m rayz`

## Testing

`cucumber`

## Formatting

`standardrb`

## Linting

Generate signatures for new class: `typeprof lib/class_name.rb > sig/lib/class_name.rbs`

Type check with `steep check`

## Grid

The canvas is a grid of pixels.  The grid is defined by the number of rows and columns.  The rows are the Y axis and the columns are the X axis.
The origin is the bottom left corner of the grid.  The X axis increases to the right and the Y axis increases up.

## Chapter 1

A projectile is shot and the position is reported until it hits the ground.

```

Projectile hit the ground after 16 ticks.
```
## Chapter 2

A projectile is shot and the position is reported until it hits the ground.
The path of the projectile is plotted on a canvas.

Run example:

`ruby rayz.rb && cp projectile.ppm /mnt/c/Users/craig`
