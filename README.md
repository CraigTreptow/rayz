# Rayz

An implementation of a ray tracer based on the ["The Ray Tracer Challenge"](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge) book in Elixir.

### Plan

1. Make it work.

## Current Status

As of 2022-07-11 I have finished the book, _Grit_ and it has inspired me to try this again.

## TODO
- [ ] Generate new project with `mix`
- [ ] Configure CI
- [ ] Configure formatter
